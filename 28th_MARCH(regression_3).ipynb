        "* Ridge regression is a regularization technique used in linear regression to prevent overfitting of the model. It differs from ordinary least squares regression in that it adds a penalty term to the loss function that is being optimized. This penalty term is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients of the regression variables, which effectively shrinks the coefficients towards zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "* By doing so, ridge regression reduces the variance of the model at the cost of a slight increase in bias. This means that the model may not fit the training data as well as ordinary least squares regression, but it may generalize better to new, unseen data.\n",

        "* Ridge regression is particularly useful when dealing with datasets that have a large number of features, some of which may not be important for making accurate predictions. It is also useful when the features are highly correlated with each other, which can lead to unstable estimates of the coefficients in ordinary least squares regression."
